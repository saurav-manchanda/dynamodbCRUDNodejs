abcd	"But those wronges may I not endure, That thou speak'st of our goddes here," quoth he. Cecile answer'd, "O nice* creature,                             *foolish Thou saidest no word, since thou spake to me, That I knew not therewith thy nicety,*                            *folly And that thou wert in *every manner wise*            *every sort of way* A lewed* officer, a vain justice.                              *ignorant "There lacketh nothing to thine outward eyen That thou art blind; for thing that we see all That it is stone, that men may well espyen, That ilke* stone a god thou wilt it call.                *very, selfsame I rede* thee let thine hand upon it fall,                        *advise And taste* it well, and stone thou shalt it find;         *examine, test Since that thou see'st not with thine eyen blind. "It is a shame that the people shall So scorne thee, and laugh at thy folly; For commonly men *wot it well over all,*            *know it everywhere* That mighty God is in his heaven high; And these images, well may'st thou espy, To thee nor to themselves may not profite, For in effect they be not worth a mite." These wordes and such others saide she, And he wax'd wroth, and bade men should her lead Home to her house; "And in her house," quoth he, "Burn her right in a bath, with flames red." And as he bade, right so was done the deed; For in a bath they gan her faste shetten,*                *shut, confine And night and day great fire they under betten.*       *kindled, applied The longe night, and eke a day also, For all the fire, and eke the bathe's heat, She sat all cold, and felt of it no woe, It made her not one droppe for to sweat; But in that bath her life she must lete.*                         *leave For he, Almachius, with full wick' intent, To slay her in the bath his sonde* sent.                 *message, order Three strokes in the neck he smote her tho,*                      *there The tormentor,* but for no manner chance                    *executioner He might not smite her faire neck in two: And, for there was that time an ordinance That no man should do man such penance,*              *severity, torture The fourthe stroke to smite, soft or sore, This tormentor he durste do no more; But half dead, with her necke carven* there                      *gashed He let her lie, and on his way is went. The Christian folk, which that about her were, With sheetes have the blood full fair y-hent;                  *taken up Three dayes lived she in this torment, And never ceased them the faith to teach, That she had foster'd them, she gan to preach. And them she gave her mebles* and her thing,                      *goods And to the Pope Urban betook* them tho;**              *commended **then And said, "I aske this of heaven's king, To have respite three dayes and no mo', To recommend to you, ere that I go, These soules, lo; and that *I might do wirch*         *cause to be made* Here of mine house perpetually a church." Saint Urban, with his deacons, privily The body fetch'd, and buried it by night Among his other saintes honestly; Her house the church of Saint Cecilie hight;*                 *is called Saint Urban hallow'd it, as he well might; In which unto this day, in noble wise, Men do to Christ and to his saint service.
